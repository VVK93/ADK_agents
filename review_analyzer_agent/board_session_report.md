- **Sample Feedback**:
  > Turns out Spotify leadership has a spine after all. Principles matter these days, and I refuse to give my patronage to communists. Spotify stood for free speech by refusing to remove voices, and that counts for something. Wish they would go all in, refuse to put propaganda labels on content, but I understand they do have to protect their business on these commie app stores. Overall, good job Spotify.
  > The play portion of spotify just disappears on a regular basis. The only way i can get it to return is to shut down the app and restart it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the issue comes back immediately. Recently songs and podcasts also just stop playing. I have to go in and hit play to get them going again. That is if the play section is working. If not, it's restart the app. System stability has been a real issue lately.

### Cluster 7

- **Keywords**: premium, use, easy, update, easy use, account, log, fix, working, work
- **Sentiment Distribution**:
  - Negative: 2210
  - Neutral: 997
  - Positive: 3799
- **Sample Feedback**:
  > I love this app! One downside - the free version doesn't allow you to pick or reshuffle, and the Premium is stupid expensive. I can't afford ten bucks a month. Oh well. I'll deal with that. Other than those two things, it's awesome!
  > Lost of small bugs and glitches, the app is almost useless to use without premium and some features are hard to use. Even with premium it's quite bad. When I started using the app years ago I would've gave it a 4 - 5 star rating as you could use the free version of the app much more freely, there weren't many bugs and the app was overall just better.

### Cluster 8

- **Keywords**: lyrics, lyrics songs, language, english, songs lyrics, like, feature, available, lyrics song, lyrics feature
- **Sentiment Distribution**:
  - Negative: 177
  - Neutral: 128
  - Positive: 851

  > Great service, love the lyrics feature on some songs but wow what a clunky POS of an app.
  > Every thing is perfect but please show the lyrics in language in which the song is and not any other language,

She loves singing along to her favorite tracks, especially when learning new languages or practicing her English skills.

**Background**: David is a 35-year-old podcast aficionado and tech consultant from Austin, Texas. He spends hours commuting each week and relies on Spotify for both music and his favorite podcasts, particularly long-form discussions and interviews.

## üìù Meeting Summary

# Spotify User Board Meeting Summary

---

## 1. **Pros & Cons per Feature**

### **A. Expanded Lyrics Availability & Language Support**

**Pros:**
- **Enhances language learning:** Users like Priya find lyrics essential for learning and connecting with songs in Hindi, Korean, Spanish, etc.
- **Boosts engagement:** Singing along and understanding meaning deepens user connection to music.
- **Inclusivity:** Addresses gaps for non-English/regional music fans, broadening Spotify‚Äôs appeal.
- **Potential for added features:** Real-time translation and pronunciation guides could further enrich the experience.

**Cons:**
- **Technical complexity:** Accurately sourcing, syncing, and displaying lyrics for a vast, multilingual catalog is a major challenge.
- **Coverage gaps:** Regional and indie tracks, especially in Indian languages and K-pop, often lack available lyrics.
- **Potential licensing hurdles:** Securing rights for lyrics in multiple languages/regions may be complex and costly.

---

### **B. More Affordable Premium Lite Plan**

**Pros:**
- **Accessibility:** Makes ad-free or less restricted listening more attainable for students, budget-conscious users, and families.
- **Flexible value:** Users can access key features (like fewer ads or some offline access) without paying for full Premium.
- **Potential to retain free users:** May convert frustrated free users (like Marcus and Linda) who find ads and lack of control off-putting.

**Cons:**
- **Feature trade-offs:** Concerns about which features would be limited or excluded (e.g., offline downloads, lyrics access).
- **Perceived value:** If Lite is too stripped-down, users may not see enough benefit to justify even a lower price.
- **Revenue risk:** Could cannibalize full Premium subscriptions if not carefully differentiated.

---

### **C. Improved Offline Mode Stability (Especially for Android)**

**Pros:**
- **Reliability:** Ensures downloaded music is always available, crucial for travelers and users with unreliable internet (e.g., Jenna).
- **Cross-device consistency:** Seamless syncing between devices (phone/laptop) reduces user frustration.
- **Reduces churn:** Users less likely to switch to competitors when Spotify ‚Äújust works‚Äù offline.

**Cons:**
- **Technical hurdles:** Android fragmentation and device variability make universal offline stability difficult.
- **Syncing complexity:** Ensuring real-time, automatic updates across devices can be challenging.
- **Limited impact for free users:** Offline mode improvements mainly benefit Premium subscribers, not the free tier.

---

## 2. **Overall Sentiment & Key Takeaways per Persona**

### **Priya Ramesh (Student, International Music Fan)**
- **Sentiment:** Strongly positive about expanded lyrics, especially in non-English languages.
- **Priorities:** Lyrics coverage, language support, and features that aid language learning (e.g., real-time translation, pronunciation).
- **Concerns:** Technical feasibility of lyrics for regional music; Lite plan must not cut essential features.

---

### **David Martinez (Podcast Enthusiast, Commuter)**
- **Sentiment:** Neutral-positive; focused on podcast improvements but empathetic to music features.
- **Priorities:** Better podcast discovery, organization (folders/tags), and sharing; would welcome similar enhancements for non-English content.
- **Concerns:** Current navigation is clunky; wants more intuitive management and discovery tools.

---

### **Jenna Lee (Frequent Traveler, Creative Professional)**
- **Sentiment:** Strongly frustrated with offline mode; reliability is a deal-breaker.
- **Priorities:** Seamless, trustworthy offline playback and syncing across devices; clear download status and auto re-syncing.
- **Concerns:** Android app is especially problematic; unpredictable offline access disrupts workflow.

---

### **Marcus Green (Budget-Conscious Student, Free User)**
- **Sentiment:** Frustrated by ads and playback restrictions; feels stuck on free tier.
- **Priorities:** Fewer, less repetitive ads; more relevant ad targeting; greater playback control.
- **Concerns:** Premium is out of reach; Lite plan could appeal if it addresses ad load and playback but worries about lost features.

---

### **Linda Foster (Busy Parent, Value Seeker)**
- **Sentiment:** Pragmatic but frustrated by cost and technical hassles.
- **Priorities:** Affordable, convenient listening with fewer ads; easy account management and reliable updates.
- **Concerns:** Premium is too expensive; login/app update issues disrupt usage; wants simplicity and reliability.

---

## 3. **Points of Agreement & Disagreement**

**Agreement:**
- **Lyrics Coverage:** Priya and others agree expanded, accurate lyrics‚Äîespecially for non-English tracks‚Äîwould significantly improve the music experience.
- **Ad Frustration:** Marcus and Linda (and to some extent, others) agree that frequent, repetitive ads in the free tier are highly disruptive.
- **Offline Reliability:** Jenna‚Äôs pain with unreliable offline mode is echoed by others who value dependable access, especially on mobile.
- **Need for Affordable Options:** General support for a mid-tier (Lite) plan that balances features and cost.

**Disagreement:**
- **Feature Prioritization:** Priya prioritizes lyrics, Jenna prioritizes offline stability, Marcus/Linda focus on ads and affordability‚Äîreflecting different primary pain points.
- **Podcast vs. Music Focus:** David‚Äôs podcast-centric perspective means his priorities (discovery/organization) diverge from the music/offline/ads concerns of others.

---

## 4. **Final Recommendation**

**Conditional Go:**  
Prioritize expanding lyrics coverage (especially for non-English/regional tracks) in the next quarter, as it offers the broadest daily impact and aligns with strong user demand. However, improvements to offline mode stability on Android should be addressed in parallel, given the severe pain points for mobile users. The Premium Lite plan should be explored with careful feature selection to avoid undermining full Premium value; ensure that essential features (like lyrics and some offline access) are retained to justify the upgrade for budget-conscious users.
